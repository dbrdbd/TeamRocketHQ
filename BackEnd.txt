Start Function
	create grid here
Update
	where all the checks and stuff go
	if loss of block -> event Function 1
event Function 1
	will drop rest of blocks and add in new blocks (pull from function randompieces here too)

Notes
Start function = before first frame or physics update occurs
Awake function - for each object in the scene at the time when the scene loads
	all awakes finish before start is called
MonoBehaviour.LateUpdate() - called after all update functions have been called, to get elapsed time since last call to LateUpdate, use Time.deltaTime

to destroy object use function Destroy within Collider or within MonoBehaviour
http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Destroy.html
Time.fixedDeltatime - time within fixed frame rate updates are performed
Time.maximumDeltaTime - maximum time a frame can take
Destroy function - destroy an object after the frame update has finished or after a short time delay

The phases of compilation are as follows:-

Phase 1: Runtime scripts in folders called Standard Assets, Pro Standard Assets and Plugins.

Phase 2: Editor scripts in folders called Standard Assets/Editor, Pro Standard Assets/Editor and Plugins/Editor.

Phase 3: All other scripts that are not inside a folder called Editor.

Phase 4: All remaining scripts (ie, the ones that are inside a folder called Editor).

maybe consider using namespaces to differentiate between graphics, movement and rest?

start function
	create grid here
	use random function 2 to help

Update
	check movement validity, etc etc
	if all is good -> event Function 1

Event Function 1
	will Destroy that set of blocks and add in randomized new objects
	use random function 2 to do this

Movement Function
	all Henry

MAIN FUNCTION
	Start
	Set time
		Movement function
		Update -> Event Function
		have a basic incremental counter that will act as score
		repeat until timer runs out
	Print out score
